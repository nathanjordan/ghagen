/**
 * Determine which TS/JS source files contain each `uses:` ref string.
 *
 * Used by `deps upgrade` to scope `applyUpdates` to user-controlled
 * source files. Internal vs. user-authored paths are classified with the
 * shared predicate in `_package_paths.ts` (also used by
 * `_source_location.ts`).
 *
 * Implementation note: user-file tracking is a UNION of two observations.
 *
 * 1. The primary mechanism diffs `jiti.cache` before/after importing the
 *    config. `cache` is typed, non-deprecated public surface — jiti's own
 *    `types.d.ts` declares `Jiti extends NodeRequire { cache: ModuleCache }`
 *    with no `@deprecated` marker (unlike its call/`resolve` signatures).
 *    It is kept deliberately over the `transform` hook, which misses
 *    plain-CommonJS helpers (native require, no transform call).
 * 2. The cache diff cannot see native-ESM (`.mjs`) helpers: jiti loads them
 *    through a plain in-process dynamic `import()` (its `nativeImport`) that
 *    never enters `jiti.cache`. A Node module-customization hook registered
 *    via `module.register` observes exactly those ESM loads and augments the
 *    diff (see `ensureEsmHook` below).
 *
 * See docs/adr/0004-user-file-tracking-via-jiti-cache-diff.md. The real-jiti
 * integration test (`sources.test.ts`) is the canary for both halves.
